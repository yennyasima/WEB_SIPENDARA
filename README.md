This GitHub repository contains the WEB_SIPENDARA application, a web-based Geographic Information System (GIS) designed to map and visualize the spread of Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) in Yogyakarta City.

The application's primary goal is to provide an interactive and user-friendly tool for monitoring and understanding the geographical patterns of DHF spread, which can aid in prevention and control efforts.

Technology and Implementation
This application is built using the Laravel framework, a robust and efficient PHP platform for web development. Laravel provides a strong foundation with essential features like:

A flexible routing system.

Eloquent ORM for intuitive database interaction.

Support for job queues and real-time event broadcasting.

In terms of technology, the project relies on:

CSS and JavaScript for a responsive and interactive user interface (UI), especially for map elements.

Blade, Laravel's templating engine, for building dynamic web views.

PHP for backend logic and data processing.

Furthermore, the presence of a docker-compose.yaml file indicates that this application is containerized using Docker. This simplifies the deployment process and ensures consistency across development and production environments.
